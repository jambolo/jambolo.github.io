## Applications

### Advent of Code 2025 Visualizations

I am experimenting in using AI (currently ChatGPT-Codex) to generate visualizations of the solutions to Advent of Code 2025. The designs and implementation of the visualizations are completely done by AI. I have only minimal input beyond implementing the instrumentation in the solutions.
